## About This Repository

I work on SEED Labs using a **MacBook Pro with an Apple Silicon (M-series) processor**.  
Due to architectural differences, several of the original example codes require adjustments to run properly on my system.

To ensure full compatibility, I run the SEED Labs environment inside:

- **VMware Fusion**  
- **Ubuntu (Linux) guest OS**  
- Docker-based SEED Lab containers

This repository stores the modified scripts, configuration files, troubleshooting notes, and environment setups that I created while adapting the labs to this environment.
